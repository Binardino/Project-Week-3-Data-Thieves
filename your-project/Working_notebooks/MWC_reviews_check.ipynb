Especially the expanding table turned out to be very useful for a group breakfast. The only thing we really missed was a radio system or working speakers to be able to play some music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen was very well-equipped and clean and the dishwasher (with tablets!) proved very useful for a group of 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spacious bathroom was very clean and pretty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the beds (first room on the right) was downright horrible, but, luckily the living room sofabed presented a solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been warned about the pool not being open this time of year, which we very much appreciated because it would have been a huge bummer. However, we would have hoped to be able to visit the roof nonetheless, which was not possible as there were constructions being carried out.

He then came in and told us he had touched her bikinis... he has a SERIOUS problem with females! \\nWe dropped a tiny bit of sand in our room, when we asked him for a dust pan and brush he came into our room pointing in my friends face and shouted \"F*CK OFF, you dirty little girl!\" He was desperately trying to intimate us which I have a video of him doing so... We have never been spoken to in such a disgusting and disgraceful way! Anyone to stay here should expect to be treated with no privacy and absolutely NO respect! Also the bathroom has a big hole in the back of the shower which leads to the kitchen so you feel as though you are in the kitchen with them whenever you are in the bathroom! \\nFinally the apartment is on the 5th floor with a tiring amount of stairs and the hallway is full of cockroaches, horrible... and the air con continuously stopped working everyday. \\nBarcelona is an amazing place, we just wish we had payed a bit more for somewhere else so that our trip wasn\\'t ruined by our accommodation.',\n",

Brought me to the bathroom to show me how bad it was.  I apologized and understood her. She gave me the mop to clean it myseld. Told me \"You shower as an Asian person. Only they shower with the curtains out\".  In the next 16hours she send me 2 more messages saying that she has never had other people leaving the bathroom in such a terrible way. We were the worst of all.  It was humiliating and very immature. You can\\'t treat customers like that and it was just water.  We come from different cultures and you should not treat people like that, especially when they pay you so much.\\n She ignored us till the rest of our stay. \\nIf you really like being punished and nagged and if youvare a naughty, nasty person like us - it\\'s the best place to stay... unless it doesn\\'t collapse till then, as everything there us either not working or repaired with duck tape.',\n",

Due to the central location, we were able to walk to the best hot spots or travel by taxi quite cheaply when we were too tired from walking. The apartment is set on a quiet road with local residents. The balcony is great as it allowed my friends and I to sit out at night & watch the locals milling about. \\nI felt that Aga's communication throughout the booking process was excellent. Her host Roxanna was helpful and was present on time to hand the keys to us. She was also waiting for us to pick up our bags at 5pm as we had an evening flight which we greatly appreciated. \\nAlthough the listing states that the apartment is 3 bedrooms, this is not true. There are 2 bedrooms and a living room with a sofa bed. This was fine for me and my friends. \\nThe beds themselves were very comfortable. The mattress is a nice memory foam mattress, not a horrible spring one. 2 bedrooms had balcony doors to allow sunshine to pour through during the day. \\nThe apartment had air conditioning which was much needed during the 30 degree temperatures. The kitchen  was fully equipped and there was also an espresso maker with ground coffee beans which we enjoyed in the mornings. \\nThere are 2 bathrooms available within the apartment. Both had  overhead showers that were powerful with hot water available. We had access to wifi which worked perfectly well during our stay. Close to the apartment are several supermarkets selling food, alcohol and basic amenities. There's also a tobacco shop selling cheap tobacco located 5 mins away. On my second day I went to a local pastry shop (3mins walk) and we had freshly made croissants dusted with powdered sugar and café con leche - creamy coffee. \\nI would recommend this apartment to all travelling to Barcelona. I would definitely stay here again. \",\n",

We had a horrendous journey from the UK with our flight being delayed 3 hours and arriving at the airport after midnight to find there was a taxi strike.

She was very understanding and met us at the apartment at 4am and did not complain at all.\\n\\nThe apartment was clean and had all that we needed. We were really only showering and sleeping there so we did not need many amenities except wi-fi which worked well. The area can be a little noisy at night and early morning and there was a horrible yappy dog somewhere nearby so earplugs are recommended.\\n\\nThe area has lots of good restaurants and some great breakfast places though our eating was mainly more central.

The room was incredibly small, and SUPER hot, when we arrived, many things were \"supposedly\" broken then night before such as, lamp, bed support slabs, and no fan!! It was so hot we could barely sleep. It was super noisy outside as well. Also, the towels for the shower was old and rough, the bathroom had bugs and there was no cleanliness whatsoever. Very dirty and always moist and musty. The kitchen was horrible and not capable of cooking. Overall, the stay was super bad and I don\\'t recommend it at all.

       "       'Experience from the nightmare My sister and I traveled to Lisbon earlier this month, and as we had connection flight from Barcelona that required an overnight stay, we decided to rent a room using airbnb service. We found this room https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/577027 that seemed to be ok and as Pedro have a lot of good reviews, so we reserved it. That was an experience from nightmare. At first, the room and as the whole apartment was nothing like the one from pictures. It was crowded with stuff and with various people, and very dirty and untidy in general. Pedro explained that he made some kind of mistake, so room we actually rented is not available, but that he will give us his room. Room was just awful, dirty and with nothing except bed and a table, but we thought never mind, we will just spend a one night there. However, we went out for a dinner, and when we come back and wanted to sleep, we noticed that we have only pillows and one or two very dirty comforters with no covers at all so my sister and I decided to use towels as a pillow cover and I asked Pedro if maybe he has one clean sheet or duvet cover we could use. Comforter was as dirty as it was never washed, and except dirt in general, it had a lot of stains that seems as urine and/ or sperm/ and or blood. In the moment we asked that, he converted to a monster. He started yelling at us, told us to show him the spot where exactly comforter is dirty, told us if we thought we are princesses, told us what we expect for 25 euros, told us to go to leave his place... I can hardly remember all the awful things he said, as me and my sister still have a trauma, and are giving our best to forget that experience. He was yelling really loudly, and getting into our faces, with horrible smell of alcohol, so I suppose he was drunk and or on drugs. However, after a few minutes of yelling he took comforters and told us now you will sleep without anything. We were really scared, because it was about 1 pm in unknown city, and was afraid what of what he could do to us, so we decided to leave and find a hostel or even go directly to the airport. I decided to ask him for money return, my sister was against it, but I said that’s the only thing we can do to show him that his behavior is not acceptable – ask for money back and leave. I guess he thought that he can get away with that violence, because that was my first time using airbnb, and also he thought that at 1 in the morning we will not be able to leave his place. When we said that we are leaving and asked for money, he was kind of...',\n",
       "       'I had such a horrible stay with Adrian and his wife Daniela that I had to leave due to safety reasons. I was supposed to stay for 17 nights, but only stayed for 4. As a married female solo traveler, I was hoping to explore the city on my own while being able to prepare a light meal once in a while at home and having a place to shower and sleep with friendly interaction with my hosts. I am an independent 32-year-old and enjoy having some time for reflection (though most would call me extroverted). Here are some of the reasons as to why I did not feel comfortable in this apartment: 1. The front door does not open easily, and the key often jams. There were times I needed to buzz to come up, making me much more reliant on them than I wanted to be. I could not simply come and go as I pleased. 2. They do not respect personal space or one\\'s need to have little interaction to spend time alone. I would say hello but didn\\'t want to necessarily share information about myself other than my background and why I was here, which they did not understand at all. I felt forced to have long conversations with them each day, as they would ask me my plans, and I found extremely invasive and intrusive. I did not think they needed to know my every move. To call this overwhelming is a serious understatement. I wrote a message to Daniela via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) to explain my point of view, but this did not change. 3. On my first day, I changed my clothes after some long travels. Daniela called me sexy, and it made me uncomfortable (Adrian was there). She also wanted to know everything about my life instead of letting me settle in (I hadn\\'t even fully unpacked at that point but she was calling my name from the living room). 4. The following day, I asked if I could work out in the apartment, in which case she URGED me to do a work out video with her (she is an instructor). After a few minutes of trying it and feeling uncomfortable, she said I could work out in the living room. She sat down and watched me and gave me tips, completely unprovoked. This was strange to me. 5. My last night was the last straw. I arrived at 11PM and I went straight to the kitchen to make tea and get some water before taking a shower and going to bed. I did not realize both of them were up, and Daniela entered screaming \"Coocoo!\" which alarmed me to say the least, as it was completely unexpected. Shortly thereafter, Adrian came in to explain how to use the key to the terrace, which had already been explained to me on another occasion. There was alcohol on his breath. He noticed I was struggling with the stove and offered his help...',\n",

It makes me not going to use airbnb anymore! It makes me feel the host as well as Airbnb are both unreliable, unresponsive and unsupportive! Now, here is the list of what I experienced. If anyone wants more evidences, I have all proofs for this host! 1. The air conditioner doesn't work. 2. The duvet was not enough. 3. The toilet was leaking from the second day. All the problems caused me no sleep during nights, because the bedroom basically was modified from balcony and it's connected to toilet (curtain was used to separate the bedroom and toilet). Actually all problems could be solved easily if the host was responsible. However, the most terrible part is that the host didn't response all phones, text messages and airbnb online messages, all the possible means I could think of to contact him. Then I tried to call the cleaner Anita who couldn't understand English at all. She asked another person to talk in the phone and told me that she would call me back in 10 minutes, but never call me back. Therefore, I stayed with all problems from the day I arrived and the day I left. Can the host reply my message this time now?\",\n",

We personally found the apartment quite dark and always had to have lights on. We had pictured a loft but in fact it is a ground floor and the windows are so high up you feel like you are in a basement. The ground floor was great for not having to carrying luggage up flights of stairs though. So bonus for no stairs. \\nHaving that basementy feel everything was always damp. We did a few loads of laundry but the clothes never dried. We had the drying rack out at all times. No sun light to dry and with the constant feeling of damp, we wore wet clothes out just so they would dry. Yes there is a dryer but unless you can wait 4-5 hrs for your load to dry it is useless. We tried it a few times but still the clothes never fully dried. Frustrating to have constant wet towels for showering. \\nThe bed is amazingly comfortable. The pillows were awesome. However, the blankets/sheets still felt damp all the time. We tried sleeping with the bedroom window open but RIGHT outside your door & under the window are 3 residential garbage compactors. The residents in the area dump their garbage there and you can constantly hear glass shattering and garbage being dumped. The handrail going up the stairs is broken. I pinched my hand the first time I used it. \\nParking a car is an issue (all over Barcelona) but we rented a motorcycle and you can easily park on the sidewalks. We never had an issue with leaving the motorcycle overnight. \\nWe re-read the current reviews and we are bit surprised no one else mentioning the bathroom. The shower is deadly slippery. We have never experienced such a slippery shower ever. The glass door is only 1/2 the width so water is everywhere on the floor. There is a constant sewage scent in the bathroom and it was frustrating us. We couldn’t wait to leave early everyday and come home late just to avoid that horrible smell. \\nCommunication with the host was fantastic. Quickly responds. We met her at check in and never saw her again. It was a very easy transaction to negotiate. \\nThere is a fruit market right across the street and two streets down lots of tapa bars, places to get coffee and ice cream. Exactly as the ad says, you are located very close to Montjuic. Up a few streets and a ton of stairs but you end up right at the cable cars. It is Barcelona so expect a lot of walking.

Fortunately, the water pressure was very good everywhere in the kitchen and the bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

You cannot sleep on the upper bed because there are huge noises whenever you move in that bed. The lower bed is better than the upper one, but you just sink into the bed.\\r\\n3. Extremely narrow shower booth: Though I am an average-sized woman, the shower booth was too narrow for me to take a shower. Every move I make in that booth made me bumped against the wall. This was the biggest problem that my family shared.\\r\\n4.

As someone that works in hospitality, I tell him that I have felt he has lacked in professionalism and hospitality since the beginning of my stay, in a calm and kind manner. He then, loses his temper, and becomes very defensive. He starts calling me a bitch, fake, and other profane names. He is screaming at me. I sit and say nothing. He leaves the room and goes on his phone and starts talking about me to someone. He comes back and yells that I leave immediately. I tell him that is fine, I will leave. I say let’s cancel the reservation then. And he agrees. I pack my things and leave. He is continuously shouting profane things about me, while I have no response to him.\\n\\nI am not sure what is going on in his life to treat someone like this, because it looks like he has great reviews in the past, but I hope this does not happen to anyone again.

       "       \"We stayed in apartment 2'2 for 5 nights. It was very disappointing and there was a large variance between the pictures presented on air bnb and the actual apartment. There were many flaws in the apartment and the host service as follows:\\n\\n- On arrival the apartment was not overly clean. The microwave and oven were very dirty as were the cutlery and the floors. \\n- For an apartment suited to hold 6 people there were 2 wine glasses and 4 coffee mugs, one which was thoroughly cracked.\\n- The whole apartment is very 'worn out'. The couch and chair are very stained and the couch is ripped. The counters are stained and have some water damage, the walls are scuffed and the bathrooms have some mould.\\n- The second bedroom is not as presented. It is two mismatched, single cots. These take up the entire room. There is not even space to walk in between the beds. Due to it being cots with thin mattresses, we had horrible sleeps. There is also just one white sheet on all of the beds. There are uncovered duvets in the closets but not all of them looked clean.\\n- Very few supplies are provided. There were no dish clothes to wash dishes (this was needed as the dishwasher was clogged), no garbage bags, laundry soap, etc.\\n- The wifi is very inconsistent.\\n- The overall customer service on the part of the host was very poor. We have stayed at many air bnb locations around the world and have always had excellent service. Usually a binder is left with instructions on the apartment, some maps, suggestions on what to do, etc. We received none of this. We booked transportation from the airport with the host and still had to wait 25 minutes outside the building for the 'check-in guy'. The check-in man was rushed and was only concerned about collecting the city tax not with providing us any information. When we asked him how to use the laundry or if there was soap he did not know. Therefore, not only did we have no information on the surrounding areas, we had no information on the things in the apartment (TV, washing machine, dishwasher, garbage, etc.). \\n\\nOverall I would definitely not recommend this apartment until it is properly maintained. This was a very poor representation of air bnb for our parents which is really not the case. We have stayed in magnificent air bnb rentals with very great host service, this is just not one of them!\\n\",\n",

The interior of the apartment is absolutely dirty and almost everything he has in there should be updated and the apartment needs a deep clean-up/update or renovation. At first glance it looked \"ok\" but once you are in and sit anywhere or use the bathrooms you realize that place is in a terrible state. The place smells bad, mold like smell. Very strongly. Dirt all over. The kitchen and bathrooms are truly gross. Inside the cabinets, microwave there was dirt. The countertop was dirty and the dish-rack was rotten and dirty! The refrigerator wasn\\'t working at all and it made a terribly loud noise constantly all day and night! The bathrooms have mold, black mold around the bathtubs and in many areas. The second bathroom was so disgusting, the floors were dirty and full of hair and dirt, the door doesn\\'t open correctly and the toilet was dirty! The worse thing is the bathtub in that bathroom is completely disgusting, stained with dirt for many decades and on top of that dirty with newer layers of dirt... and mold even around a window and the soap-dish. We only stay one night and couldn\\'t take it anymore and contacted Airbnb to help us move somewhere else. Even the sheets on the beds, they seam clean, but once you get in... there is crusts and pieces of disgusting things attached to them as if they weren\\'t washed properly. Needless to say, it cost us a lot more money to make the move because we still got charged for the one night plus fees, and the worse part of all, we lost one full day in Barcelona!!! Additionally all the absolutely unnecessary stress that we were subjected to all that day ... We had a horrible time trying to connect to internet using our cell phones to try to contact a hundred times with Airbnb (they were helpful) they refunded us partially, but unfortunately we had to do all the work in contacting directly the new owners of places available... and to try to finalize the deal with the one apartment took forever because Airbnb\\'s site blocked my account temporarily or something happened that we couldn\\'t book the place for a couple of hours and we suppose to be out of Gio\\'s dump hours earlier. All the stress, the expenses that we had to go through and the loss of one full day of our short four day visit to Barcelona (one night that we had to sleep in that dump, and the second day wasted completely trying to leave it and to find a new place... and moving) was totally unnecessary. People like Gio should be banned from good companies like Airbnb. I suggest there should be local inspectors hired by Airbnb to make a basic check up of the places listed to make sure...',\n",

I\\'ve stayed at many Airbnbs and this was the first time I\\'ve had a host be anything but lovely, let alone so horribly rude to me, I felt physically sick.  Just recalling it now I feel sick again, but I thought people should know. I\\'d asked whether they could recommend a babysitter, and they suggested someone at double the market Barcelona rate. So I said no thanks, I\\'d use an agency for that price as I would have the security of a vetted and insured sitter. The response was a nasty \"you are wasting people\\'s time. Go ahead and save money in your kid\\'s security\"  which despite its nonsensical nature I was just sickened that someone could be so horrible. The agency sitter cost less even than the one they suggested.\\n\\nIts really made me reconsider using Airbnb because if someone is rude to you at a hotel, you can complain to management and won\\'t have to deal with them again. Here you are stuck already having paid for the whole trip and no choice. After the rude message I never heard from the host again, so we didn\\'t know what to do at check out, we just left the keys and left. The morning of check out was weird- someone prank buzzed the flat and didn\\'t respond, then a bit later there was a second buzz at the door bell and someone asked if there was anyone Philipino living there. Racist bizarre way of checking if we\\'d left yet maybe?\\n\\nAlso the flat is shabby and not worth the cost.  The walls in the smaller bedrooms are scuffed like the last guests slept with their shoes on.  The towels smell musty like they were left wet for too long. The shower in the bathroom doesn\\'t work properly. One of the bedrooms has a window into the living room (maybe it is legal in Spain, I don\\'t know).

Lo primero, que hace un frio que te mueres¡¡¡ Vale que tiene un aire acondicionado frio-calor que tienes que tener puesto todo el día, pero es que en la obra de reforma de la casa les dejaron sin tapar como un metro cuadrado de pared exterior que no se ve a simple vista porque está por encima del falso techo del baño, no entendiamos como hacia tanto frio si teníamos la calefacción todo el rato puesta, y lo descubrimos casualmente ya que el termo no funciona bien, e intentandolo buscar para ver si podíamos tocar la temperatura del mismo ya que el agua caliente dura escasos 5 minutos, lo que da para una ducha para uno, nos dimos cuenta de que el baño estaba a la intemperie. Además, la junta de la ducha esta rota (por debajo del metal de cierre de la mampara) y como el desague de la ducha no funciona bien, no traga apenas, se empezaba a salir el agua y medio se inunda el baño. Por último, no está bien puesto el desague de la lavadora a la bajante, y sañe un olor horrible, que hace que el piso apeste, tuvimos que tapar nosotros mismos con papel de periodico el desague porque de verdad, que el olor era asqueroso. Menos mal, que con el agujero de la pared del baño rapido se ventilo, porque como estaba la ventana abierta las 24h del día pues eso que ganamos.\\r\\nPor otro lado, el tema de la limpieza, para mi gusto es regulin, cierto que es una percepción muy personal, pero el edredon estaba sució y las mantas, se veía que hacia bastante tiempo que no se limpiaban.\\r\\nCosasa positivas, internet va muy bien, el piso es bastante comodo así como la cama, y tiene lo suficinete para una buena estancia en la ciudad.\\r\\nEn cuanto a la localización, esta bastante cerca del metro (un pelín alejado, pero vamos que no tardas nada en llegar a los sitios), y tiene los servicios básicos de un barrio para poder comprar lo necesario para tu estancia (panadería riquisima, y un establecimeinto de comida preparada que la comida está realmente rica).\\r\\n',\n",

Coverings were missing from light fixtures.  It looked like something in a New York ghetto.  There was graffiti throughout the whole neighborhood.\\n\\nThe couch in the apartment was dingy.  One of the walls had a handprint still on it.  Our bathroom door had water damage and a hole through it on the bottom.  The paint was peeling off our bathroom wall.

She immediately accused us of having hardcore sex (which we weren’t) and was yelling at us and demanded we pay her $25 euro’s. In an effort to move pass this minor unforeseen incident, my boyfriend and I agreed we’ll pay her the money even though we were not at fault at the end of our stay with her. The second night went smoothly though we were out most of the night. Our third day there turned out to be the most horrible of all. Flor was extremely rude and disrespectful, it’s one thing if we were staying there for free but we payed to stay and in no way deserve to be treated in this manner. My boyfriend and I used the bathroom together in an effort to eliminate the time used in the bathroom. Within 25 minutes she was banging on the bathroom door yelling at us. However a guest prior (spoke Spanish and not from the US) was in the bathroom 30+ minutes while we patiently waited and Flor never rushed her out like she did to us. I’m extremely disappointed and regret wasting my time at her place. She will probably write an awful review of us in defense of herself. I Do Not recommend staying with her, unless you want to walk around eggshells. We ended up leaving and finding a different place to stay and I’m glad we did. You pay money to go on vacation and be stress free, not to walk on eggshells. As a host, being kind and courteous goes a long way. We don’t speak Spanish and felt we were discriminated and treated with less respect when Spanish speaking quests arrived. We were nothing but polite and respectful even bringing her a nice gift from the states. She can throw it away for all I care. If you’re looking for a good place to stay, don’t stay here, and if you read her feedback on this review; know that she’s defending her integrity and she won’t take accountability for her being a poor host.',\n",

An armchair in the living room was broken. A power outlet in the bedroom was pulled out of the wall about 25 mm, so a child could touch the cables. The old cistern just below the ceiling in the small bathroom did not worked, because the bast which had been used to repair the link between the rocker and the cup was broken. The owner came after 2 days and made a new repair, and that on worked for 2 days too, then it broke again. After the so called repairs the owner opened for the water supply to the cistern of course, but the cistern did not closed for the water once it was full, so the water kept running all the time, making so much noise, that it was almost impossible to sleep in the bedroom next door to the bathroom. The kitchen was a chapter in itself: The lamp hanging down from the ceiling, was a naked lightbulb hanging directly in the cables. The plastic cover of an electric junction box in the wall had apparently vanished and was replaced by a piece of paper towel, The lightbulb in the refrigerator was broken. The refrigerator was very noisy when the compressor worked, and since the refrigerator was very old, it worked almost all the time. The hood over the stove was very noisy, but it worked though. The ceramic glass stove plate was broken, and a repair had been tried. The water tap at the kitchen sink was of the type where one turns the handle from cold to hot, but here the whole tap turned, since it was not firmly attached to the table. Even the website list showed that there were a coffee machine, there were none. The apartment was said to be able to house 6 persons, but there were not knives, forks, spoons, dishes and glasses to make that possible, luckily we were 4 only. The kitchenware was horrible, not a single knife able to cut anything at all. Pots and pans was almost beyond description: All handles was loose, and all bottoms vaulted. In a mediterranean country a grater for cheese and other things is a most, but that was also missing. The website on airbnb give one an impression of a roomy, nice and orderly apartment, but that is all wrong.

       "       'Montserrat is a gem.  She is the warmest host we’ve ever had. My boyfriend and I got our backpacks stolen in Valencia earlier that day and we’re feeling really beaten down and sad, but Montserrat was such a nice place to land after such a horrible day.  Her sweet personality and cat, Miss Tina made us instantly feel safe and at home with them.  While we were out exploring Barcelona, we felt 100% safe that our belongings were secure and that we would get back and forth safely as we came and went; something we both desperately needed after the experience in Valencia.  She provided breakfast every morning (yummy toast, jam and a muffin with coffee and OJ).  The place was clean and provided enough space for the two of us.  Communication was very quick/responsive and easy (through (Hidden by Airbnb) translator).  We wish we were able to speak the language so we could chat with each other more!  The only two recommendations we’d suggest, were that the bed was not comfortable and the shower was difficult- old hand held shower head that made showering slightly chilly and cumbersome.  Despite that, we’d absolutely stay again and so appreciate her efforts and extra touches!! Absolutely stay with them if you can, kind/wonderful place and person!!!',\n",

The building is very old and nothing has been updated except maybe kitchen cabinet doors.  It is very noisy--extremely noisy.  Half of the outlets do not work and there is barely any lighting.  There are absolutely no amenities--not even the basics.  The elevator will not accommodate more than 3 people and is slower than taking the stairs.  The hot water is horrible and the showers do not drain.  One shower doesn't even have a shower head holder.

The dedicated AC unit allows you to set your own room temp. And the dedicated bathroom is clean and adequate. I used the kitchen for breakfast and preparing food for the road and there is a supermarket with  most essentials around the corner. \\n\\nThe apartment is perfectly located. It’s a minute from the L3 metro line and the Mountjuic fununcular. I arrived at the Sants train station and walked half an hour to the apt., but could have easily taken metro to the “parallel” station. Carla’s tapa crawl (which I also recommend) starts about a 3 minute walk away. The Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk; the Picasso museum about 24 minutes; walked back from Parc Guell in a little over an hour. ( parc G is currently under rehab which is too bad, but I highly recommend doing the walk back which takes you through the neat neighborhoods north of the Diagonal and down through the fancy shopping district along the Passeig de Gràcia.) There is a very good gym four minutes from the apt where you can get a one use pass for 11 euro or a week pass for 34 (Aiguajoc). \\n\\nI highly recommend Pep and Luis’ place for a great Barcelona visit.',\n",

Furthermore, the bathroom is across the hallway from the room, which meant that at any given time we could run into someone. There were four other families staying in the apartment during our stay. \\nMore about the room. The room is small, and does not have a window. The ventilation is poor and you are not in control of the temperature. The first night it got very hot and stuff, we asked the host to turn on the air, which she did, but the air was limited to only the evening. During the day, we could not relax in the room as it was extremely hot. To make matters more uncomfortable, there was a horrible smell that plunged the apartment. Thus, while the room was clean, the smell and the heat made it unbearable. \\nThe host was kind and respectful, but the room added unnecessary stress to our vacation.

We were verbally harassed and threatened by the host who said we would be sent to court if we did not pay a fine of 200 euros. After telling her that there must have been some miscommunication, she accused us of lying even though we were showing her evidence of us not being in the Airbnb when it had happened. She failed to provide evidence that we caused the damage. We felt very unsafe and threatened by the host as two young female students from America. As a result of this situation, we spent the last few days in Barcelona stressed out and unable to enjoy our time there. The host acted extremely unprofessionally. If the situation was real, she should have handled her interactions much better instead of screaming at two young defenseless girls. We are extremely disappointed with our stay at Tendency Apts. We do not believe this is the way people should be treated. We felt extremely attacked, threatened, and scared by this situtation. We do not, under any circumstances, recommend using Tendency Apts. for booking Airbnbs .\",\n",
       "       'PROS:\\nIt was clean and cleaning team was leaving as we arrived. There are two air conditioning heads, one in the bedroom, one in the main area and that was awesome for the temperatures we had (25-28 July 2019). If you\\'re a good walker, it\\'s easy to walk to Park Guell, Sagrada Familia, Rambla and even the beach (all within 3KM) but a taxi ride to these places is also very cheap. Tendency group was quick to respond.\\n\\nHOWEVER...\\n\\nWe left with a bitter taste in our mouth. Not sure if I should consider this a scam but the appartment we got ***IS NOT AT ALL** the appartment in the pictures (a.k.a the one we booked based on the pictures). When we got there with one of the team members, we indicated that it was the wrong place but she said it was the right place (and by the looks in her face, she seemed like she knew that we knew). So she called management and we were informed that \"it had been fully renovated\" and that they \"hadn\\'t had the time to change the pictures on the site to reflect the renovations\". I\\'m sorry but I don\\'t buy that at all for many reasons. Perhaps it has been renovated but definitely not in the recent years. A user reported the same issue as us in November 2018 and management\\'s response was the same we got (place got renovated).\\n\\nI have done enough renovations in my life to tell that this appartment has not seen renovations for a while AND that it\\'s not what we reserved. First off, you rent an appartment and you don\\'t update the pictures for many months? Really? That\\'s a crap excuse. We booked in February 2019 and got in the place on the 25th of July. The other user reported the problem in November 2018... and you don\\'t have time to take new pictures and update your ad? If you renovate the place, wouldn\\'t you want the users to see the renovations rather than old pics? That\\'s complete non-sense.\\n\\nAlso, what leads me to believe it\\'s not the same appartment is the bathroom as they are opposite (picture and what we got)! In the one we got, the shower is to the left, small sink on a cabinet in front and toilet on the right with a bidet next to it. The toilet and bidet are in their own enclosed area with a door insde the bathroom. In the pictures, the toilet and bidet are on the left (not in an enclosed space) and the the sink is self-supporting therefore I figure the shower is on the right. So, it\\'s not the same bathroom! I know how complex plumbing can get in a north-american house because I\\'ve done more than enough plumbing and I figure it can get even more complicated in an old building. So why on earth would someone swap-around an entire bathroom\\'s worth of plumbing just for fun? That is complete non-sense as well.\\n\\nRegarding the kitchen, the one in the pictures seems like a nice big modern kitchen with orange glossy cabinets. The kitchen in the appartment we got was old with white doors but yellow-ish cabinets (you know, white cabinets aged so they have a yellow tint)? Also, the cabinets are skewed therefore one door has its top corner flush with the cabinet corner and the bottom corner exceeds the cabinet by about 1cm (sort of like a parallelogram shape). Also, whoever installed the wooden counter top did a horrible measuring job because the counter is partially above the sink to the point where the counter top had to be partially sanded down in order to gain access to the faucet which was sort of annoying to access due to the lack of space.\\n\\nThere has also been an apparent severe flood at some point in time because the kitchen floor boards have soaked in water for a long time because it is a \"floating floor\" (no pun intended) and you can clearly see the boards are all bulged-up and has lots of broken corners. The vertical cabinet panel between the fridge and washing machine has black mold at the base and is splitting due to excess water. The flood line is actually visible in the bathroom all around the wall at about 1 cm from the floor in the toilet area and it is clearly visible at the base of the toilet-area door because the door has also been submerged in water for some time.\\n\\nYes, we have agreed to keep the place after talking with management just because we were with our kids and we have no idea what owners can do if we\\'re not happy (e.g. kick-us out) and we didn\\'t have any options and it was already paid for.\\n\\nAnyhow, despite that we feel like we\\'ve been somewhat scammed with false advertisement and we paid for something we didn\\'t get, the appartment was still very clean, has A/C, is close to everything and it was the perfect size for a family of four. Still, lying doesn\\'t get you anywhere hence this review.',\n",

       "       'BEWARE IF NOT WANTING TO BE QUIET!\\nThe IMPORTANT thing that Paola doesn’t list online (at least she hadn’t when we booked for our April 2019 stay) is that her place has quiet hours starting at 10pm. Even though she doesn’t list this online, there are multiple posted signs inside the apartment saying that the “NEIGHBORS WILL CALL THE COPS IF THEY HEAR NOISE IN THE APARTMENT OR HALLWAY AFTER 10PM, AND YOU WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE.”\\nWe found it extremely deceptive that she didn’t advertise this at all on the listing, and I hope she changes this in the future. We were a quiet group of 3, and the cops were not called on us, but we still felt worried at night… It greatly lessened our comfort level in the apartment, as you can imagine…\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThis COULD be a great value, if you are quiet guests. The location is just as good as advertised, and Paola is a decently responsive host (she responded to our messages, and was helpful with our check-in, though she had other issues, which I address below). In my opinion, the beds weren’t very comfortable, and the rest of the apartment wasn’t as comfortable as the pictures make it look, but it’s a cheap place, so the value can be worth it.\\n\\nBut, the main issue of the quiet hours aside, there were a host of other issues with our stay.\\n1)\\t~ Loud, music-playing neighbors ~\\nIronically with the 10pm quiet hours, Paola’s neighbor immediately below the apartment started playing LIVE experimental jazz music at 12:30am on our first night there, and continued well into the middle of the night past 4am… This included an actual drum kit and booming bass guitar… This made it impossible to sleep and gave us a horrible start to the next 2 days. I wouldn’t believe it myself if I hadn’t experienced it first-hand... When we went down to ask her to stop, she was antagonistic and refused, even with the quiet hours, because “you are tourists, and I don’t have to listen to you”.\\nInitially, I would only mention this as a warning to future guests and wouldn’t just hold bad neighbors against Paola, but her response to them was unsatisfactory. When we complained to Paola about the egregious noise problems, asking her to deal with the neighbor, her only response was to “send the neighbor a message”, but didn’t persist when she didn’t get a response. So, we had to deal with a SECOND night of horrible jazz that we couldn’t sleep through. It wasn’t till we complained AGAIN that Paola tried hard enough to make sure she actually spoke to the person and got her to stop for our 3rd night, when we could finally sleep…\\n\\n2)\\t~ She does not have a full kitchen, as advertised! ~\\nThere is no oven. There is no microwave. She does have a stove, but only 1 of the burners actually works. Hopefully she fixes this for future guests.\\n\\n3)\\t ~ You should double-check any of her recommendations for places before you go. ~\\nWe went to use the luggage storage she recommended on her list that she left for guests, but there was nothing there… She responded to our message about it that it had closed long ago. We wasted the money of a cab, and stress of having to figure out an alternative on the street with paid data, as opposed to on the comfort of a couch with wifi. All because she didn’t spend the effort to change her instructions and print a new sheet.\\n\\nSo - it’s definitely not a 5-star Airbnb, but if you don’t mind saving money by staying at a cheaper place with great location (easy/cheap cab ride into the center of the city; walking distance from Montjuic and many great tapas places), and don’t mind being quiet at night (under the apparent risk of having the cops called on you and being kicked out…), it’s a worthwhile stay.\\nJust have your expectations in check and read the other reviews to see what other guests have said.',\n",

On top of it the check in process took about 15 minutes, it was a waste of time and complicated, not what you expect from Airbnb which is supposed to be simple and easy.

Going up those stairs was not short of a horror film. My friend had just had surgury so for her going up and down stairs was horrible. True to their word they did have the elevator up and running before we left. I feel like they should have offered some sort of compensation due to the elevator not working as it was no small feat going up and down those stairs. Would have not booked this place had I known the elevator situation. I understand it may have been out of their control but then they need to offer compensation to their guests not shrug it off like no big deal.

The building the apartment is housed in however  suffers from acoustic issues in that you can hear the front door close and peoples' conversations clearly although this did not affect us.   In the end we were  sad to leave as we had got very comfortable staying at the apartment.\\n\\nThe metro system is a very efficient way to get around to many of the tourist attractions.  And we only used this although there are buses, trams and taxis if you want to use them.  Otherwise we walked around the places we visited and discovered many places along the way.  \\n\\nOur favourite places were La Boqueria market for the food, the Gothic quarter because of it's charm and our favourite place to eat authentic tapas was Quimet Quimet.

The main living space was adequate for our needs during our stay. We really enjoyed the location of the apartment as it was walking distance (15 - 30 min away) from a lot of really great sites!

       "       'This place is in a perfect location - it\\'s close to everything, and makes for an amazing starting point in exploring Barcelona. However:\\n\\n- like the other reviewers said, the sound isolation is horrible. Not only towards the street (the street is very very noisy at night - people partying, motorcycles revving, etc), but inside the apt as well - the doors don\\'t stop sound at all, so you can hear every breath other guests make. This is especially bothersome because all the doors are very noisy, and all the locks old, so almost everyone has trouble locking/unlocking their doors - and that\\'s a lot of people in an apartment where more than 3 rooms are for rent.\\n\\n- the listing says there is WiFi, but there is only \"partially\" WiFi. The host\\'s husband, Gonzalo, a stay-at-home Youtube-watcher, got upset at our using it several times - so much so that he angrily stomped through the hallway towards the WiFi extender, pulled it out of the wall, and took it into his room. This happened on several nights, several times. He pretended not to know English when confronted and just kept yelling \"WAIT A MOMENT\", turning back to his ballet videos. Luckily, he didn\\'t change the admin password for the main router, so I was able to connect to it and manually reset things from time to time, making 10-minute internet intervals possible. This was important to me because I booked the room to get some work done - I work remotely, and the only way I can travel around is if I also work. If they had said there is NO wifi, I would have been fine with that and I would have bought a SIM card on day one. But they said there IS wifi, and there was none, so false advertising and a very uncomfortable passive-aggressive host.\\n\\n- on one occasion, the same person saw me enter the bathroom to brush my teeth. One minute later he knocked on the door. I ignored it because I just wanted to brush my teeth. The door is impossible to lock - it only has a single little hook which kind of \"locks\" it, but not really. One minute after the knocking, he barged in. Luckily, I wasn\\'t doing anything private - but he has zero respect for other people\\'s amenities.\\n\\nGenerally, I wouldn\\'t have any problem recommending the place if it weren\\'t for Gonzalo. The bathroom, while extremely small and often occupied, considering how many people stay in the apartment, was more or less clean. The towels smelled of moisture and mold, but those are minor details one can expect from a shared apt. The most important factor when staying in AirBnb places is comfort - feeling wanted and welcomed, and that definitely wasn\\'t the case here. I haven\\'t seen passive-aggression so strong in a person (especially of that age) since high school.',\n",

Quite  impersonal.  The person who greeted us was fine, just don't expect a host.  He gave us the keys and opened the door, but didn't give us any instructions on now to use anything, and told us to be careful not to lose the keys.  Nothing wrong with that but don't expect a personal touch from them.  They also don't respond to every inquiries before the trip, making it quite frustrating to work with them before getting there.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThey also don't supply basic things like bath soap, shampoo, and laundry soap.

The A/C in the bedroom barely works and there is NO A/C units in the other 2 bedrooms. Also the ceiling fans shown in the bedroom and living room are decorative and do not function. 3. The first bathroom has no counter space at all and he second bathroom has a clogged bathtub drain. Meaning if you shower in the second bathroom, expect to stand in ankle high water and slip. The drain is full of hair! 4. Upon check-in there was only one half roll of toilet paper in the entire unit and no hand soap in the bathrooms or kitchen. I know there is an expectation to purchase some amenities in Air bnb\\'s but seriously toilet paper? Who wants to exit a 9 hour flight and go buy toilet paper? 5. There is no flat sheet on the beds. The only bed covering is a fitted sheet over the mattress and a empty, musty duvet coverlet on all beds. There is no sheet to coverup with. I found tons of hair on the duvet cover and it smelled like other people\\'s cologne...clearly meaning it was not washed. Also, there are no pillows with covers on the beds, just decorative pillows with the musty duvet covers on them. 6. The unit is stated to sleep 7 people....another lie. The first 2 bedrooms are small, dark (no windows) and warm (no circulating air). We had to request a fan just to make the bedrooms livable. The picture of the \"spare\" roll away bed is a joke. The actual roll away bed is a pencil thin, pop up bed, with a stained mattress and no linen for it. My friend was going to sleep on the roll away as the 2nd bedroom was horrible, yet there were no linen for the \"spare\" bed. I found one comforter in a cabinet. It was white and covered in yellow stains. Also, the washer smelt moldy and had left over items from prior guest. I can only assume that was not on the...',\n",
       "       'SweetInn really needs to pay more attention to its places. We had a horrible experience here that could have been entirely prevented with better management. On our check out day, we were told to leave our keys in the apartment and head out — which, on the plus side, seemed very easy and convenient — BUT we weren’t told that the front door to the building gets locked overnight, and if you are the first one out for the day, you have to have a key to leave. At about 7am on the morning of our checkout, we left our key as instructed and walked downstairs to find the front door locked, leaving us stranded in the entryway of the building, at risk of missing our flight. With no way to get back in the apartment or out of the building, we tried to call management, but no one answered (we eventually got a response a couple of days later). We ultimately had to beg a neighbor to wake up and unlock the door for us. She informed us that this was not the first time this had happened — in fact it was quite common. I could not understand how SweetInn wouldn’t know about this problem and make it incredibly clear to guests that they should check to see that the front door is open before locking the keys in the apartment. \\n\\nAside from our horrible experience at check out, there were a couple of other shortcomings that are worth noting. First, the layout is a bit odd — there is a frosted glass wall between the two bedrooms — which detracts from privacy and makes it difficult to sleep in one bedroom if a light is on in the other. This wasn’t a huge deal, but it was frustrating since we were looking for a two bedroom apartment. Second, the showers in both bathrooms need attention. The grout is old and moldy and in dire need of retouching. And, the shower in the guest bath backed up — which SweetInn repaired — but then it flooded with each use because it was poorly laid out. \\n\\nOn the positive side, the apartment was indeed well decorated, and the location was great. But, on whole, we felt we had paid more to have a better experience with SweetInn and felt that it fell far short of expectations.',\n",

I was told at 2:30pm once I called the host, that I had been sent an email a moment ago stating that the Airbnb would no longer be available at 3:00pm (as noted), but I would have to wait until 8:00pm in the rain because the house had not been cleaned from the stay before. \\n\\nWhile speaking to Sergio about the situation i mentioned that this was very inconvenient, being that we’d just flown from 8hrs away and had not showered or rested prior to arriving. Sergio then replied, “this is not a hotel, so you will just have to wait or you can cancel and go to a hotel where they will work on your time.” At that point i told him, that I would just follow up with Airbnb as his attitude towards the entire situation was out of line. \\n\\nHe was very rude about the situation and did not apologize about it once we were finally able to enter that night. The first thing Sergio asked once we finally got into the apartment was, “What time do you plan on leaving?” - not welcoming at all. \\n\\nOur stay was less than 24 hrs and we were rushed out the following day by Sergio. He even mentioned calling the police to the cleaning lady in Spanish as if we were refusing to leave. Overall the stay was not welcoming & the apartment smelled horrible from the moment we walked in.

The bathroom is clean; however, it was so stinky and there was only 1 window in the bathroom's side; therefore, we couldnt open it. The room was much smaller than in the picture. \\nFurthermore, the attitude of the host made us feel uncomfortable while using the kitchen even we tried to talk to them, but the old woman almost tried to ignore us. \\nOverall, it is not worth my money and I strongly recommend you not to book this place.\",\n",

There were no apologies, and he seemed rather irritated by the imposition. I promptly checked out. Airbnb refunded the prepaid bill with only partial aid by the owners.

I reported back to gala and her mum who in fairness were disgusted at this action and agreed it must have been someone in the building,  they reported to administration, but also told us to make a formal report to the police.. we tried in vain. we were only there for 3 days.. i have heard nothing from hosts since we came home. The trip was unfortunately ruined by the actions of this horrible character he didnt even have the decencey to leave a note to let us know bikes were not allowed in the lobby he just decided it would be nicer to smash up the bike instead.

Several of the chairs were so uncomfortable that you couldn’t use them. The BED in the master was HORRIBLE.  It sagged so much that you’d roll into the middle. \\n*The BATHROOM sucked. Lighting is TERRIBLE and the sunken tub is flat out dangerous. We left the light on in there to keep from stumbling into the tub at night. That said, there was plenty of hot water and a good shower. \\n*On the surface the place is in great shape it there are several loose tiles that are hazards and a loose panel on the landing outside the bathroom that makes a LOT of noise when you step on it.

Every meaningful tourist attraction is a significant walking distance away. If you plan to take the subway/tube everywhere, there is one located relatively close. However: Sagrada Familia, Born/Picasso Museum/Old City, Barcelona Cathedral, Las Ramblas etc...all far away, even decent shopping is quite far off. \\n\\n(2) TOO MANY SURPRISES: For example, I received a text message alerting me that men would be stopping by to check the heater in my apartment. I am pregnant and happened to be very sick at the time. They gave me no notice. I told them I was not comfortable having anyone come over right then. They didn’t care that I was sick and told me it’s happening anyway and that it shouldn’t take long. They were there for half an hour! So uncomfortable. \\n\\nApartment received is not what I chose or paid for. The apartment I chose had a street view and balcony. Upon arrival, I was placed in an apartment in the back of the building with a tragic view. The Weflatting representative (who left the keys with a stranger and wasn’t there when I arrived) left me a voicemail saying “I know this isn’t the apartment you chose, you chose a 1 bedroom and this is a 2 bedroom, but this is what we had available, so you can stay here, but we might have to move you at some point if we need the 2 bedroom” WHAT! So unprofessional. \\n\\nLater when I voiced concerns about the apartment they put me in, it was thrown in my face that they gave me a 2 bedroom instead of a 1 bedroom and that I should have appreciated the upgrade. I don’t need another a larger place. Didn’t ask for it. Don’t want it. I want the room with the view that I chose. They tried to use this as leverage to make up for the issues I experienced. The customer service is horrible. BAD attitudes all around. \\n\\n(3) You are never in touch with the owner of the apartment. Your contact is a representative from Weflating. The experience is impersonal and the individual who represents the apartments in this building was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional. For example, there was significant construction right next door. All day, every day from 8am - 5pm, LOUD drilling. I notified the contact provided and here is her response, copied and pasted from (Hidden by Airbnb) : \\n\\n“April, i am sorry but it is not our fault that there are construction works in the building next door. I understand it is not comfortable and you are not comfortable. however you cannot blame us on the noise or inconvenience” \\n\\nWOW. I find it incredibly misleading and unacceptable that the construction was not disclosed beforehand and furthermore, that the attitude towards tenants is what is reflected in the above quote. I never got the impression that they genuinely cared about any concern I may have had. \\n\\nIf you rent an apartment in this building in the foreseeable future you will not be able to: ever sleep past 8am, make calls during the day, watch television, relax or do any sort of work whatsoever. \\n\\nI took recordings of the noise and sent them to the Weflatting representative. I waited 2 weeks for them to follow up with me...no response. When I reached out to complain again about the noise, here is another direct quote from our (Hidden by Airbnb) conversation: \\n\\n“excuse me, i had no alternative for you.” \\n\\nAlso...\\n\\n“of course with the construction there are no quiet apartments”\\n\\nThe bottom line is, the people are not nice to work with. It’s not the apartment itself as much as Weflating being a problem. \\n\\nAfter much negotiation, I was refunded for 1 week of my stay, which under normal circumstances would have made it “okay” - After all, as long as they make an effort to remedy a situation that’s all you can ask for, but if you are treated poorly, argued with and quite frankly, yelled at over text, whatever follows doesn’t matter.

       "       \"Where do I start?  We had this trip planned for several months, and it was a family reunion in Barcelona... a city none of our group had ever visited.  Obviously, we were all very excited to take in the sights and sounds of this beautiful Catalonian city.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the first sights and sounds we took in after our check-in was that of electric saws, hammering, and workers talking in the common wall apartment next door at 8:00 am.  After being awakened by the construction workers, I immediately informed our hosts of the problem.  They replied with an apology and said it was out of their control.  However, someone was able to obtain a concession from the construction workers that work would not begin until 10:00 am.  And, while they were good about that start time until our last morning, it seemed only fitting that we should be awakened by construction noise on our departure date.\\n\\nI can't impart the horrible experience that each of our group endured as a result of the construction work next door.  How the hosts and/or property managers were unaware of the construction work next door is beyond comprehension.  If I had been given notice about the work I would have attempted find alternative living arrangements.  But that didn't happen.  We were stuck in this place for the duration!\\n\\nWhat made things worse was that there was a lingering odor that permeated the common area of the apartment.  Not until my brother - the civil engineer - arrived did we learn that the odor was likely sewarage that was escaping from the apartment's plumbing caused by faulty or defective venting in one or more of the common-area bathrooms.  The smell never went away, even though one got used to it once inside.  However, each time we came back to the apartment after a walk about, that smell would hit us.\\n\\nAdditionally, the hot/cold water controls in the north bedroom bathrooms did not work properly.  Only scalding hot water came out after an initial period of cool water on shower start.  We informed the hosts of this problem on Saturday (April 13).  Workers showed up on Tuesday (April 16) night and were unable to fix the problem.\\n\\nBy the way, for those unaware, construction work occurs on Saturdays as well.  So, if this is an apartment you are considering, I would suggest you contact the hosts and/or property management company to find out how long the construction project wil be continuing.  It looked to us that the entire apartment was being gutted, and refitted.  \\n\\nFinally, and a last comment about the construction work.  There is a door that leads to an interior patio and to the washer dryer.  It also opens to the apartment across the way.  So, to access the washer/dryer, you were possibly standing next to one or more workers.  So, our privacy was impacted in an even more uncomfortable way. \\n \\nOn a more pleasant note:  The neighborhood of Villa Gracia was marvelous!  Hidden gems located throughout.  Easy access to the Metro and wonderful restaurants.  Remove the horrendous problems stated above, and I can say the apartment was laid out perfectly and created plenty of space for each of our three couples.  The bedrooms and common areas had true character and made for an excellent presentation.  The outside patio deck was excellent.  Late afternoon wine and cheese is a must.  \\nI wish I could have been more positive about the unit, maybe at another time.\",\n",

So many idling young guys hung around and we were so nervous and scared! Of course, I have to admit the landlord asked his roommate to pick us up, which might be the only light in this dark experience. When we met, he kept inquiring us constantly: why couldn’t you find the way??? I had told you the address!!! I had send you the screenshot of the map!!! why couldn’t you find the way while others could???

I called the number provided and the man who answered (not Oxis) said he was expecting us at noon and I'm not sure why because that was never arranged.

The flat looked different from the pictures and was not very well-lit, except for the living room with the balcony which was a great feature. One bedroom did not have air condition, but every other room did - found that odd. There was a horrible smell coming from the kitchen that was apparently from an outdoor pipe that was leaking air into the flat. We had to keep the kitchen door shut otherwise it filled up the entire flat. We ran out of toilet paper by the last day and there was no extras to be found, so ended up sharing the last roll between bathrooms.

       "       'SUMMARY:\\nI am traveling with my parents (3 of us), and stayed for 3 nights in this place, and I can say this is the worst Airbnb I have ever stayed at, by a mile; and I have been in 30+ Airbnb places (half of those I booked on my own), mainly in the customer service area. This is my first time having to leave bad review for an Airbnb place (and I have never left any bad review for any Airbnb hosts before).\\n\\nABOUT THEM:\\nThe apartment we stayed in is owned by a big company, Friendly Rentals. They operate hundreds of apartments and houses. You could find how horrible most of the other people\\'s experience with them if you (Hidden by Airbnb) \"Friendly rentals review\" and search their reviews on Yelp, Tripadvisor, or other forums.\\n\\n\\nPOSITIVE:\\n+ Really good location. Close to a harbor, and pretty quite neighborhood.\\n+ Can drop-off your luggage in their corporate office location before your check-in time or after your check-out time\\n\\n\\nNEGATIVE:\\n\\n- Double handling in check-in process:\\nSince they operate under a company, you have to take your apartment key in their corporate office first, and then go to your apartment. This makes things harder, since you have luggages, etc, and you have to pay more for transportation, especially if the place you booked is not within walking distance of the corporate office.\\n\\n- Apartment elevator not working:\\nThis apartment is really old, and when we stayed, the lift was not working. The description says the apartment is in second floor, but you start at floor zero. One of my parents has a walking disability, so it is really hard for us to go up and down 2 floors everytime without elevator.\\n\\n- If you ask for missing or need more amenities, their response will be \"this is a self-catering apartment\":\\nThere are 3 of us staying for 3 nights, yet we are only given 1 small tub of shampoo and bath soap (think about the free one you get if you stay in hotels). I asked for some more shampoo or bath soap, and also we were out of toilet paper. Their answer for my requests is \"as you know on the apartment description, this is a self-catering apartment.\" \\nNow if you see in the description, NOTHING says that this is a self-catering apartment. I have triple-checked it (even right before I am writing this review). If you see it now, then they must have added it after looking at this review.\\n\\nI have stayed in another apartment owned by companies too, but their service level is much higher than what I experience from Friendly Rentals. E.g. they still give you more amenities (soaps, shampoos).\\n\\n\\nP.S. This is my own experience, and I tried to be as objective as possible when writing this review. Maybe Friendly Rentals in other cities are different, or other travelers\\' experience are different too. However, this is what I experienced from my stay so far.',\n",

The windows do not shut properly which further exacerbates the already awful noise situation. I know this is Born (bar central) but properly shutting windows would help block some of the sound. There is no wifi. I repeat NO WIFI!

When maintenance arrived the gentleman was already aware of the issue. He also warned us that the host was notorious for charging guests for dirty towels when he saw how filthy the towels were from cleaning up the leak. He was nice enough to take pictures and send them to the host to show that they were dirtied from cleaning up all the leaking water. The beds in the unit are cheap and squeaky. There is one air-conditioning unit in the living room which does NOT cool the bedrooms. They could at least provide fans for each room. Overall I would not recommend this unit.

We saw cockroaches in the kitchen and in the bathroom any time; it is a sign of lack of cleanliness.

The 3 gentleman immediately confirmed our suspicions and we quickly backed our bags and headed back to the office to sort our new accommodations. Unfortunately, since the booking was made via Airbnb, Friendly Rentals washed their hands of any responsibility to help us out. On top of that, Airbnb didn’t do a great job helping us out and we were left to find our own accommodations last minute on a Friday night for a group of 5 for the entire weekend in Barcelona. We wasted our entire evening due to the lack of any form of help from Friendly Rentals or Airbnb. The experience was terrible right from the time that the problem was discovered and we feel horrible for anyone who stayed in the unit in the 2 weeks prior to our arrival. They surely took bed bugs with them to their next destination, or worse, home.

Third, they have stated they got a hair dryer in the 'room', but obviously there is no hair dryer in the 'room' by that time, then I ask the host if there is any hair dryer in the 'room', he ask me to buy it by myself in the shop! and tell me that cost 5 euro, are you serious? i tell the host that it stated there is a hairdryer in the 'room' on your page, after that, he buy me a new hair dryer, and i saw the price is 9.95 instead.

       "       'Don’t expect to be greeted by Oscar or Diego. In order to check in you have to go to an office building which I’m assuming is a company that runs several condos. The location of the office was a bit difficult to find. They give you an address but don’t tell you a specific name and for people that are not from the area this made it a bit difficult. You also have to give a $300 refundable damage deposit. From the office the apartment was at walking distance so we walked with our luggages while the person who greeted us at the office guided us about two blocks down (mind you we were a group of 7 so this was a bit inconvenient) to the apartment. When entering the apartment building you are immediately hit with a horrible stench that reminds me of a dirty bathroom stall. There is no elevator in the building so we had to carry up all of our luggage’s, thankfully we only had to go one floor up. The person that did our check in showed us quickly how to unlock the doors and turn off the alarm. That was basically it. The A/C wasn’t working and neither was the light in the living room. We had to call to get it fixed but still the A/C only worked well in one out of the four rooms. We didn’t have any toilet paper or paper towels. Thankfully we had a super market close by. The apartment itself is disgusting. The walls are dirty. The floors are dirty. The furniture is worn out. DO NOT GUIDE YOURSELF BY THE PHOTOS.

The only things that we wasn't happy about was on our arrival we was expecting to meet the host but when we turned up we waited outside for 20 minutes then was let in by the cleaner. We took the small lift up as it was about 9 floors up! We was then greeted by the cleaner who spoke no English and we couldn't ask the questions we wanted e.g where was good places to eat? Where was the shopping? Etc... So we was quite disappointed not seeing the host. The cleaner told us to come back 3 hours later as she was not ready which was fine as we wanted to go and explore anyway. Before we booked this place we asked if we was near anything and was told yes. We was miles away from everything at least 30/45 minutes walking distance which we didn't want so we ended up getting cabs everywhere which was reasonable pricing. Barcelona is a beautiful city and we had so much fun but if we had known we wasn't close to the tourist part we wouldn't of stayed. At night we kept hearing noises like the wind because there was gaps in the doors. Neighbours banging around late at night when we was told to be respectful which we was and I should imagine the residents should be Aswell. The pictures are not quite the same as real life as one of the terraces have a big ditch in the floor which you cannot see in the pictures and the views were not what we imagined. They supplied a mini bar which was an excellent idea as it helped us out a lot!! The way the place is designed inside is good but the terraces are not what the picture shows. The small bathroom has no door in the bedroom so we didn't use it. Not enough toilet roll. Oh and the bed was horrible to sleep on we all ended up sleeping on the sofa bed!! As it was rock solid and so uncomfortable. \\nOverall the place was ok if your only stopping by for a short visit then this would be good a place to stay. It is very well designed inside. Was a shame we couldn't meet the host!! \\nThanks for letting us stay at your beautiful place we had a great time in Barcelona and would be revisiting Barcelona again. \",\n",

We were able to get through the next couple days by covering the shower drain and leaving the bathroom window wide open. Very disappointed in the stay due to the smell and the cleanliness. The bedroom was also very small. This was a huge issue as we didn't spend too much time in the room, but two people with luggage had a hard time fitting in there and being able to move around.\\n\\nThe location was great though!

He was very insensitive and chewed our brained out for half an hr over phone.

This is horrible why do i have to wait for another guest to check-in. And also it almost seems like the host was instructing me rather than just being nice and apologetic about it. Because of the attitude of the host i am giving it a terrible rating. Besides the host actually didn't arrive at 7:30pm either and was not at the place until 8pm. The pictures of the apartment are deceiving as the rooms have open windows and you would hear the slightest sound from outside. Kitchen area was not clean at all.

The house is at the 2nd floor and I had to climb for a very narrow and a little bit messy stairs. When check-in, the host was standing out of the house and looking at me that I had difficulty to climb since I was carrying a middle size suitcase, and she was just looking at me and say nothing, didn’t show any care of this.

It might be I misunderstood that you may ignore the above comment. However, when I ask more questions she would answer and help.

Felipe was abroad and left a friend in charge of checking us in but she wasn't able to meet us until 7:30 to 8:30pm. We understood and rode the metro to the area around his apartment to wait at a cafe. His friend then tells us we have to meet her at a train station 7 stops away to collect the keys or we can't collect them until 10pm. So we reluctantly haul all our luggage, pay for another metro ride and meet her at said station at the time she specified - she then proceeded to make us wait another 30 minutes. \\n\\nFinally we got the keys and on the way back to the apartment, Felipe calls and tells us the sheets may not have been changed as his friend was supposed to do it. He then asks us to change them ourselves when we arrive!! Sure enough, we get there and the sheets are dirty and there are used towels on the floor. He also said on the phone he thinks he was the last person to use the bed, so I'm not sure why he didn't just change the linen himself before he left?? At this point, we've had enough and leave to stay at a hotel. The issues with cleanliness and check in are the fault of Felipe's friend, and we would not have left a bad review for that. The bad review is because the one thing Felipe could have done to rectify this situation is provide a refund, yet he only partially refunded us for our first stay and declined to refund our second stay (we went to Bilbao for a few days in between). I have no idea what makes him feel entitled to our hard earned money considering the horrible experience we endured, but I hope I can save other travellers from wasting their money!

We reached out again because we did not feel safe at all staying the night but again they were nothing but rude saying she couldn’t do anything till tomorrow. She was no apologetic at all. I would love for them to put themselves in our shoes. We had all our clothes thrown everywhere and laptops and money and clothes stolen from us. Who knows what would have happened if we would have been in the apartment at the time. I contacted air bnb support right away because we all felt unsafe and they were nice enough to put us in a hotel for the night. The host was no help at all and honestly very defensive when we let them know that there was another robbery here before. This whole situation seemed very sketchy and planned. You need a magnetic key to get into the actual building and then also the card for the room. There is no way someone knew where we were staying or when we would be gone.

       "       \"Yes the location is good, very close to Segrada Familia. Apartment itself is clean, but it is worn, dirt marks on furniture and walls, and one closet door was broken so I would say not as well maintain as the photos show. BUT please be warned  the communication is terrible, actually more accurately almost non existent. This apartment is not hosted by a private individual or family but a third party company with several employees that don't communicate with each other much less respond to guest inquiries in time of need. After your Airbnb booking is confirmed, expect to be pass to a third party, called GuestbyGuest and from there it all goes downhill. A few days before checkin a man by Jose reaches out to my via (Hidden by Airbnb) saying he is the host of this Barcelona Apt, his picture on (Hidden by Airbnb) shows GuestbyGuest logo and since he reached out to me and had my contact information, I assumed he was an employee of the company and gave him my checkin time and tried to make arrangements but he failed to respond after I gave him my arrival time and left us hanging despite several more followup messages, phone calls, and despite even emailing through Airbnb, no one helped us. So we arrived at Barcelona airport not knowing what to do, we made our way to the apartment address hoping for the best, but no one was there to let us in. We were a group of eight people, with 3 young children and 1 infant in the group so the complete lack of response in this case is really unacceptable as it brought upon so much stress for the adults and discomfort for the children standing on the streets of Barcelona in the peak of summer. It was unbearably hot, with crying children and with all our luggage on the streets.  After trying numerous phone numbers we finally got a live person to pick up at the office. At this point we were very frustrated but the man at the office(I did not get a name) said to me that Jose(the person who initiated (Hidden by Airbnb) contact with me as the booking agent) was not an employee of the company and was very worried for me. He said he will sort things out and call me back but never did so I called back again this time a woman picks up and says another person called Carlos is on his way to let us in to the apartment. When we finally meet Carlos he says sorry for the confusion and said Jose does work for the company but is his day off(like fine it's his day off but as a host courtesy couldn't he at least responded to my messages saying that and tell me to contact someone else at the company for assistance instead of leaving me hanging. Why initiate contact with me and say he is my host if he will be off on the day of my checkin? Absurd!) The whole checkin was a mess and very stressful. To this day, I don't know what the truth is but it is obvious that this company lacks internal employee communication with eachother and worst completely disregards guests inquiries. \\nAfter this horrible check-in experience, on July 4, after a long day of sightseeing we get back to the apartment and there was no power. We reached out to Carlos for assistant but no response to this day still. My husband had to find the circuit breaker to restore power to the apartment as a result all the food we had bought and store in the fridge, like fresh milk for the baby was spoiled. What is worst the power went out 4 additional times that night. I was so upset at Carlos lack of response that I even email via Airbnb to document this and to this day no response from the host.\\nMy experience might be out of the usual as the reviews are overall positive. I booked this apartment based on the reviews and this is why I am especially disappointed in how things turned out. Especially at the lack or response from host(host company).  When you book Airbnb at a foreign country you are relying on your host to make your stay easy and comfortable. However in my case, they only brought me stress and discomfort. At least show some decency and respond to guest inquiries or else you should not be in the business of hosting. I already requested a partial refund for all the issues during my stay and I can tell you that as of right now, the host still has not replied and I am waiting for Airbnb to assist which has also been lacking. So book at your own risk.\",\n",

Second, there is a pretty view out of all of the windows. \\n\\nHere are the issues:\\n\\nThis apartment sits on the top of a church right next to the bell tower. The bells ring every 15 minutes and It. IS. LOUD, especially when the windows are open for fresh air.... which you will need because...\\n\\nThere is a really horrible smell, which you will see others mention in the comments, that comes from the bathroom drains and there was no relief until we found something to plug the drain up after our showers. This managed to keep the smell at bay. We tried to keep the windows open in the house to keep air moving through... but then, the bells. The night we arrived, our host seemed to be surprised by the smell and bought air fresheners to try to help (unfortunately, those were also a suffocating smell). When we read through the reviews more carefully, we saw that the smell is an ongoing issue. It is really hard to tolerate a smell that bad for an entire month. Every time you walk in the door, you're bummed.\\n\\nThe mattress in the main bedroom is terribly uncomfortable. You feel every. single. spring. in your back while you sleep at night. This bed is in desperate need of a a foam cover or something to make it tolerable.\\n\\nThis is a 6th floor walk up, which doesn't sound that bad. But these stairs are very steep, even for two people in good shape. It is definitely a workout if you come and go multiple times a day like we do. \\n\\nAlso, I let the host  know about these smaller issues that are easily remedied:\\nThere were no extra sheets or towels-- which longer-term tenants need. When washed, they did not dry in time to use on the same night.\\nThere were no extra blankets or duvets-- it gets really cold in the apartment, even with the little heaters and the duvets were very thin and not enough to keep you warm.\",\n",
       "       '+ the location was perfect \\n+ it was possible to check in very early which was very important for me\\n+ the apartment was very clean except only imitation for quilt cover \\nUnfortunately there were more minuses than pluses.  If you want to share your flat on airbnb you should make the guests feel comfortable as much as possible. Firstly there were constantly new people in the apartment which was connected with noise all the time and lack of privacy for us. The worst thing in the apartment was horrible cold which was caused by open windows all the time.  There was the smell of cigarettes and I had to ask twice for towels. Small advice for host. If you offer your apartment on airbnb you have to be aware that tourist will come to your place and you have to accommodate them. Unfortunately in this case we felt more like a trouble. So far my worst experience with airbnb :(',\n",
       "       'This was the AirBnB from hell. The apartment was just OK, but the big problem was the management company. \\n\\nFirst, they kept us waiting outside in the afternoon heat for 30 mins without responding to messages until about 25 mins after check in time. Then we discover that they haven’t cleaned the apartment at all since the last tenant. The rep apologized and said that the cleaners are on their way and they won’t take more than an hour to clean. We said that that’s not a big deal and we’ll walk around for an hour. That’s when everything really went downhill. \\n\\nWe didn’t hear back from the host nor the rep at all from that moment. We ended up walking back to the apartment 4 hours after check in (at 7pm) as nobody responded to our question as to whether the apartment was ready, and the cleaning lady was there (she must have arrived at least 3.5 hours after check in time). We finally had a clean apartment at 7.30pm despite an agreed upon check in time of 3pm. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, the management company and the rep refused to respond to any message, apparently so that they don’t admit fault in writing. Then things got worse. There was a full blown annual music festival right outside the apartment every night with live bands on a major stage until 2am. It was impossible to be in the apartment. The management company should have made us aware of this as it’s clearly against Airbnb rules. Given that they weren’t responding I was forced to contact Airbnb. The management company also refused to respond to Airbnb and so we managed to get a full refund and move to another apartment. \\n\\nI would highly, highly recommend that anyone reading this avoid any listing that is managed by this company. Truly unprofessional and borderline scammy. \\n\\nI have no doubt that they’ll respond with negative feedback and excuses (perhaps claiming that they were responsive) as it seems like there was another similar incident mentioned in another feedback response below where the user claimed that they weren’t being responsive and they responded stating that they were, but I can 100% assure that with me this wasn’t the case. I sent in all the proof of this horrible experience to Airbnb who determined that I was due a refund in full after they tried to mediate for almost 2 days with no result due to a lack of response from the management company. These guys should be booted off the app.',\n",

Inicialmente le informe al anfitrión que llegaba a las 3:45pm, pero el vuelo se retrasó y llegamos a las 7pm. No conocemos Barcelona y mientras nos ubicábamos se nos hizo tarde. Al momento de llegar le escribí al anfitrión a decirle que ya habíamos llegado y lo que respondió fue que le había informado que mi llegada era a las 3:45 y que el ya no estaba ahí. Le escribí que necesitaba una solución porque ni siquiera teníamos la dirección exacta, teníamos unas maletas muy pesadas y ya era tarde, el anfitrión nos escribe lo siguiente: “If she is angry then cancel , you told me that you would be here at 4 now it is 7 , I have alot of things to do and I left it to come and let you guys in. I am on my way so please be patient and wait otherwise you can cancel if you can't wait” después de 15min el anfitrión nos informa que ya nos va a hacer entrar. Cuando ingresamos el lugar era terrible, airbnb debería exigir imágenes del edificio y de las zonas comunes, las escaleras eran horribles y la habitación es muy oscura. En las fotos aparecen imágenes muy diferentes a las reales, supuestamente ofrecen toallas, pero al momento de pedírselas nunca respondió.

We never receive the exact address, so we thought that we had been cheated and we were in Barcelona without hosting and that we had lost our money. We had to call to AirBnB service. Terrifying.

We only stayed for a few hours that night, we didn’t like it at all, ended up moving to a nice Boutique Hotel in a better area.\\nDidn’t like the attitude of Jorge at check-in. \\nWe had two flights delays, and they charged us 50 euros for arriving late. Not only that, even though we went through all that flight problem, since they didn’t accept credit card they wanted us to go find an ATM at 2 am in the morning to pay the 50 euros and 14 euros in taxes they didn’t charge during booking.

This might be a great place for students who want to save on every single euro, but for all others: for 15-20 euros on top per night, you have a very comfortable hotel room at the same great location.

We had problems with the light fittings flashing a lot throughout our stay and when the water was turned back on it ran a horrible brown colour for a while - very off putting!! Unfortunately our host did not inform us to expect this from the water and so we were shocked to say the least. \\nI cannot recommend these apartments due to the hosts communication. Following the issues above, the host was very unaccommodating when we enquired about the possibility of some compensation  and subsequently a very negative experience was had.',\n",

       "       'Aa vetted Airbnb Super Host and frequent guest for over 3 years, this has been this was without doubt my worst experience to date. When using the Airbnb platform for my travels, I specify the criteria to always be \"entire place\" and at least \"2 beds\". The listing that popped up was this hostel that appeared to have two bedrooms and two bathrooms listed in the metro area in Barcelona. Upon review of the photos, I overlooked the description saying \"rooms available dependent on availability\" - thus, this unfortunate event. When my BF and I checked in, we were given a shoebox room (12 square metres. Not even enough room to open our suitcase on the floor!) and  with a “terrace balcony” that did not allow fresh air in (the windows were sealed shut). The bathroom itself was tiny, the sink did not drain water properly and the toilet ran unless you jiggled with the flush. I honestly could not have spent 5 days in that room without being infuriated due to the value, the false presumption of my booking which was expected to have two beds AS PER THE PHOTOS. We escalated this to Airbnb contact support immediately with two agents to explain this situation and cancel immediately. Unfortunately because we were surprised with these horrible co dictions upon arrival, we were were still charged half of our booking fee. A substantial loss when you’re blindsided on another continent. The Airbnb representatives justified this loss by saying that the photos weren’t “that deceiving,” as it mentions the building being a hostel in the listing.  What I want to stress to this listing/host as well as Airbnb is that when you have a hostel, list EACH room separately per listing. This is an Airbnb, not a hotel/hostel listing platform and \"you get what\\'s available upon check in\" - what a nightmare. \\n\\nI will say only one positive feedback, the concierge who helped checked us in originally and held our luggage was by far a kind person! Lucas. He deserves some recognition on his amazing hospitality and local suggestions.',\n",

They let us check in early and leave our bags on our last day,  as we had a late flight. The apartment was in an excellent t location allowing us to walk just about everywhere. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you need, with two bedrooms and a washing machine we had exactly what we required to make our trip perfect.

       "       'Our experience at Barcelona for this property started on an extremely negative and bad note which left a very sour taste in my mouth. I had requested the host (Lorenzo) for a early check in as soon as I booked the apartment which was about a month and half back. Lorenzo told me that he can only confirm the same closer to the check in date. 4 days before check in I sent a message asking about the early check in and he said yes. His next question was what time am I expected at the apartment. I told him that my flight from Portugal was landing at 9:30am so I should be at the apartment by 10:30. All these messages were exchanged through Airbnb and hence there is clear proof of the same available. \\nWe reached the apartment at 10:30 and the keys didn’t work and we were very surprised. We called up Lorenzo thrice but he didn’t pick the phone. Then we called the office number provided to us also thrice and there was no response. We were standing outside the building in the cold with very heavy luggage as we had just come from a long trip to Portugal. Finally on the 4th attempt after 20 minutes, he picked the phone and said I never confirmed the early check in. He casually said we should go somewhere close by as the apartment is only available at 3pm. I tried explaining that we have a lot of luggage and can’t go and he confirmed on the msgs through Airbnb for early check in. His casual behavior and response to our plight was very unprofessional and I told him so. Shockingly instead of apologizing he lost his temper and started shouting on the phone. He said he will check what he can do and call me back. We waited for 15 minutes but there was no call back and he also refused taking my calls. Instead he started sending me msgs over Airbnb saying he can only activate the keys at 3pm. While all this is happening we are standing in the cold outside the building with our full luggage. After a lot of requests, he agreed to allow us to keep the big suitcases in the apartment when the cleaning ladies arrived.  he initially categorically said no to that also despite the situation we were in. We finally got the apartment at 12 noon after a lot of back and through msgs. I have to highlight here that he didn’t have the decency to call back or pick up my phone when I was calling him. His behavior was shocking and totally unprofessional. If I had to rate this apartment only on his behavior I would give zero stars\\nComing to the apartment now. The apartment is very beautiful and clean and looks exactly like the pictures shown. Our mood lifted once we entered the apartment after the horrible experience with Lorenzo. However there is one major issue with the apartment. The walls of the apartment are very thin and I repeat very thin. You can hear the next door people talking / shutting the door / playing music and even when they are using the bathroom. I am not exaggerating. We got up early every morning because of the noises through the thin wall. \\nOverall I would say that the apartment is nice and beautiful but I am pretty sure that you can find better options with less disturbance for the high price we pay for this apartment. There is no way I would stay in this place again if I had to come back to Barcelona.',\n",

We are experienced Air BnB users, having stayed in apartments around the world for more than six years and have been thrilled with the experiences. This one has to be the worst place ever. Two of the bedrooms have no natural light. Those people will always be in total darkness unless they put the lights on. The place must be over 100 years old and nothing has been updated. The bathroom had so much black mold on the tiles, shower, bath mat and around the toilet that it wasn’t usable. The shower head was taped on with masking tape. The toilet seat did not fit the toilet as it was a different size and shape. The light shades were burnt and had awful markings and we were afraid they would catch on fire. The kitchen was in horrible shape with broken drawers, hinges and everything was chipped and cracked. The clothing dryer had to be unplugged and plugged back in before each use. The batteries ran out of the one air conditioning remote so it had to be left on at the same temperature the whole time. There was only one remote for multiple units. The pictures were hung on the wall in the weirdest way which is fine except that they had the stock size and product information in the frame. Lending to the overall negative ambiance. The living room shades were broken (some up some down) and the windows were so thick with dirt that you could barely see out of them. It felt very claustrophobic. The entire place is in desperate need of an update. This is the first time we’ve ever written a review like this and we recommend looking someplace else.',\n",

       "       'Let\\'s start this off on a positive note before we get to the lengthy list of negatives…\\n\\nThe apartment is located in a very central area right off La Rambla street. There\\'s Dia & Carrefour supermarkets two minutes walk from the front door of the apartment. It\\'s surrounded by so many good restaurants and cafes you\\'ll never be stuck for somewhere to eat. I highly recommend Caravelle (Great food), Chök (Chocolate everything), and Lukumás (Fantastic coffee and donuts). Unfortunately that\\'s where the list of positives end. \\n\\nBefore arriving we didn\\'t have clear instructions on how to get in the building; All we had was an address. I messaged Nina before we arrived asking for further instructions and she responded very quickly stating that we should ring the door bell as her staff would be waiting. After standing outside the apartment building intermittently pressing the door bell for five minutes or so one of Nina\\'s staff arrived at the building to let us in. The apartment is located on the top floor so you\\'ll need to make your descent up the 110 steps or so carrying your suitcase.\\n\\nWhen we eventually reached the summit of the staircase and entered the apartment we were greeted with a scent of sewage. The gent who let us in quickly walked inside and opened every window in the apartment before showing us around. We later learned that the smell was originating from the shower (Which thankfully is separate from the toilet!). Honestly every time you enter the shower room you are hit with this horrible nauseating humid smell of sewage. Every time we came back the apartment the first thing I had to do was open the window in the shower room while holding my breath, and quickly shut the door behind me so it doesn\\'t escape into the living space. It only seemed to get worse as the days went on.\\n\\nThere was no door handle on the inside of the apartment door. This means the only way out of the apartment is use the key as a handle and pull it open while unlocking it. Let\\'s say for example you accidentally left the keys on the outside of the apartment door and shut it behind you.. you\\'re trapped inside with no way out. That\\'s such a huge safety risk! It\\'s clear there was a door handle there at one point but it must have fallen off and simply wasn\\'t replaced. \\n\\nThat and a number of other small things make it obvious that the host hasn\\'t shown any care or attention for this apartment. It\\'s pretty clear that the place has not been painted in quite a while. There is scuff marks all over the walls in the hall, in the bedroom and kitchen. There is loose wiring hanging by the front door. \\n\\nThe kettle is old and rusted. There is metallic chips coming off the inside coating during boiling. It\\'s clearly been going on for a while and for some reason has not been replaced. Beware when using and rinse thoroughly before boiling. There is an alternative of a Dolce Gusto coffee pod machine but no pods are provided. P.S. Apparently you can\\'t drink the tap water in the apartment so you need to use bottled water for making tea and coffee. \\n\\nWe were given plenty of cleaning products for kitchen and cutlery etc.. but then we were a given a sponge which looks like it was months old and had lost most of the scouring part. The tea towel also looked a bit old. We actually went out and bought our own sponges and a towel for drying as we didn\\'t feel comfortable using what we were given. We then rewashed all of the cutlery to make sure it was actually cleaned.\\n\\nInternet was useless half the time. Tiny TV. One towel per person. Paper thin walls so you can hear doors closing and people in the stairwell throughout the building.\\n\\nAlso I thought the additional fees that they\\'re trying to charge for additional sheets, extra cleaning, late checkout (€80) and lost keys (€50) were outrageous. There is a list given to you when you enter the apartment. \\n\\nUnfortunately I can\\'t post photos in the review, but I took photos of everything mentioned above. If the host actually spent a little bit of time maintaining this apartment it could be a real gem, but unfortunately this is simply a \"Set it and forget it\" type of listing with no charm or redeeming features..',\n",

       "       'This place was PERFECT! There was a negative review earlier that I completely disagreed with so I thought I would take time to give my opinion:\\n\\nFrom the start, Robert wasn\\'t there so he sent Josu to let us in. He was the absolute nicest man. He spoke great English (which I really appreciated due to my horrible Spanish). He walked us through everything, gave us some good tips on places to go, etc. There were three of us staying here (all of us are 30).\\n\\nThe Space:\\nThe bed was comfortable, the pull out couch was even more comfortable. Seriously the most comfortable pull out couch I have ever slept on. Water pressure was great and we almost always had enough hot water for all three of us to take a decent length shower. \\nThe photos really need to be updated because the looks of this place are really great! The bathroom was large, especially for the location. Kitchen was all you need. And there is a washer.  Now you are staying in El Born so don\\'t expect new and modern! But that is the charm of the neighborhood!! \\n\\nThe Location:\\nI am always wary of staying in \"touristy\" locations when I travel but I cannot say enough good things about El Born. Absolutely perfect. When I walked over to the Las Ramblas area, all I could think was \"I am so glad I am not staying over here.\" There are so many great restaurants and shopping within 2 minutes walking from the apartment.  Go to the Gin bar. Loved that one. Arcano was the best dinner we had while we were there. We walked pretty much everywhere and it was so easy. \\n\\nThe only negative is the stairs!! Oh. My. Talk about a workout. Every time you think you are there, you still have 2 more flights to go. By the end of the trip we found it quite comical. Also, we had a 6\\'4\" man with us who hit his head on the door almost every single time (I found funny, he found less so).  But all three of us absolutely loved staying here. Great value. \\n\\nThanks Robert and Josu!',\n",

They only tell you this AFTER your booking and payment are accepted.\\n\\nSecond: check-in was disastrous.\\n\\nBesides the fact that  the check-in office was a 15-min walk from the actual apartment, (which is a huge hassle when one has luggage) and that I had to wait exactly 25 minutes for my turn to check in, the person who did the procedure was completely clueless about the actual apartment. Not only did he give me false information about CRUCIAL and BASIC things regarding the apartment, but also gave me false answers to questions I had.\\n\\n- I was told to go to the first floor, apartment 1A. Once in the building, the apartments were numbered 1 and 2. No sign of 1A. So naturally I tried apartment 1 as it was on the first floor. After having wasted time trying to open the door, it turns out that I had been given the key to apartment number 2.\\n\\n- I was given a sort of magnetic key (not a magnetic key CARD, those are easy to use, but another type of key) with absolutely no instructions on how to use it. I asked many times if there was something that needed to be done in order for the door to open and all I got was no - just tap the key and push the door. That was wrong, I had to keep they magnetic key in while I turned the knob twice, and had to figure that out by myself. More time wasted. Even in the paper manual given to me at check-in, there was no mention of this type of key.\\n\\n- I was warned BY FRIENDLY RENTALS PERSONNEL about theft in Barcelona in general, and in this apartment in particular. I had even read a review that said that the apartment had been broken into and robbed before. When I asked if they had at least equipped the apartment with a safe box, the answer was no… I was shocked to say the least. But then, to my surprise, the apartment DID have safe box! Obviously, with absolutely no instructions on how to use it so that was more time wasted figuring that out on my own.\\n\\nI thought that booking through a company like Friendly Rentals would actually be simpler and smoother than booking through an individual, but I was wrong.

The toilet was leaking water from the tank to the basin. While we showered, the loosely mounted shower head would occasionally fall from the wall, striking us on the head. The pull out sofa was missing fasteners and was tied together with wire to try and hold it together. FR sent a maintenance person out twice to try and fix our concerns. They did a patch job of silicone all over the toilet, which still didn’t stop the leak. The maintenance person also used the remaining 1/4 roll of toilet paper we had and left me stranded on the toilet while my wife searched for a nearby store. They replaced the missing fasteners on the bed, but it was far to late. The bed frame was already bent and would not provide an even sleeping surface, causing my wife and I to roll to one side. The bed should’ve been replaced completely. There was no dish washing soap for us to wash the dishes. FR did provide us with dishes, partially. Again, I don’t see this as an amenity. Why include dishes but no means to wash them? One of the kitchen lights did not work. Fortunately, the maintenance person was successful at repairing the light in the kitchen. To top it all off, at the end of the day, dealing with leaking toilets and broken beds. When my wife and I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine, it was brought to our attention that we only had 1 wine glass. Seriously! FR included 2 of all type of dishes, cups or utensils we needed. But nope, only 1 wine glass. We gave numerous opportunities for FR to correct all these issues, which should’ve been taken care of before our arrival, this unit was not ready for anyone to stay in.

When I messaged David confused about what was going on, he said he was so busy he never read my message from 12:30. Danielle called me back 10 minutes later and made it clear how inconvenient this was for everyone, but luckily “Peter” is available to hand us the keys, and explained that we will be ordered to pay a 30 euro fee if we arrive after 20:00 (which we did, due to unexpected delays while traveling). When we arrived at the apartment, we were ordered to pay the “fee” in cash or we wouldn’t receive the keys. That was after we waited outside the apartment for 20 minutes due to Peter claimed he didn’t receive my text that we had arrived at the building, even though it showed on my phone that it went through just fine. \\n\\nYou would think after all of that, you might at least wave the fee?\\n\\nAfter we checked in, the first thing both my husband and I wanted to do when we arrived, is take a shower. What do you know. The drain is clogged. Of course, a standing shower with no tub only takes about 3-4 minutes of shower use before the risk of flooding the bathroom. When I messaged David first thing the next morning, his response was “We are aware of the issue and there’s nothing we can do at this time”. \\n\\nLater that day (still within 24 hrs of checking in) David messaged me to inquire what time we will be checking out on our check out day, which was three days away.\\n\\nI have never felt so unwelcome and unimportant at an airbnb in my entire life.',\n",

Tiny common space with furniture that was falling apart. And only one bathroom (for six strangers), which was NOT disclosed in the listing. \\nClean? Yes, but old towels, upholstery, sofa cover that should have been tossed a long time ago. Sagging sofa with springs pushing up. Toilet seat was falling off toilet. Depressing.',\n",

This was never mentioned in the listing. What a massive waste of time. \\n\\nThe listing advertises as there being things such as soap, shampoo, cooking oil, salt and pepper etc. NONE of these things were provided. Our party was of 6, they provided two towels. Even after requests to the host only two additional towels were provided. \\n\\nThe sofa bed  was broken and was impossible to be slept on leading to two people in our group not getting any sleep for the two nights we stayed here. The host was made away, they came to see the problem, said they would replace the sofa bed  for our stay due to the problems and never did and stopped responding to communication.  One of the beds out of 3 beds had a mattress which could be slept on, two single beds had a horrible mattresses and the sofa bed was broken as well. \\n\\nOverall a horrible host, horrible company and horrible experience, stay far far away from these people, don’t waste your money like we did.\\n\\nBecause of these problems the additional nights we had in Barcelona we decided to spend at another apartment, Olala apartments - that was an amazing experience.\\n\\nAnyone thinking of staying with Alguera apartments, DONT DO IT, you will regret it. \\n\\nCheckout Olala apartments, it was an amazing experience Compared to these crooks.',\n",
       "       'This room is not equipped for 4 people. There was no ventilation and the single fan was far from useful. The photos of this apartment made it appear that it would be a much larger room, but the beds had less than a foot between them, absolutely no room to move around, and the lighting was horrible. Additionally, every time someone came out of the bathroom, the light came on. It was impossible to shut the curtains though to keep the light out because it would have stifled the room even more. To alleviate the heat of the room, my daughters had to sleep with wet towels as it was absolutely impossible to get any sort of rest with the heat of the room. We were fully aware that there was not air conditioning offered, but with zero air flow and a small fan, one could not even breath.',\n",
       "       'Positives: The host communicates from the beginning very friendly, polite and responsive. We appreciated his tips regarding the road from the air-port to the appartement. Negatives: Airbnb shows a different location which is finally about 600 m far away from the real address BUT these 600 m are 15 minutes hill-climbing from the nearest subway station. This fact you will find out only after your payment. In case you plan to spend just 2 days in Barcelona could be survivable. But in case you spend there a week and climb it twice a day in a very hot summer - horrible! Second, there is only one shower ( +WC ) and one WC in the whole house which accommodates almost 10 people. Taking a shower in the morning or evening requires endless waiting. Note: for two days of our stay no hot water, we had to fix by our selves - change of gas bottle. 6 days we had to use one towel, even we asked for replacement two times!!! Further observations: Photos of rooms look much better than reality. One small fan for cooling is absolutely insufficient in hot summer nights. Installing some AC would be very helpfull. 360° view of Barcelona? Maybe, but not from room or flat - small window ( if any ) with bars. No balcony. People have problems to open or close the house door by the authomatic \"no-key\" system. Better instructions from the host would be an approvement and avoid desperate clients trying check in the house in the very early morning or late night. In short, never seen the host, the accommodation itself is not worth the price at all, pictures do not reflect the reality, big disappointment. Never more!!!',\n",

Also, there is no air conditioning or fan in our room so it was horrible to sleep, and the room doesn’t close. We also didn’t get keys during our stay so always need someone to open the door.

       "       'It was exactly what I wanted when coming to Barcelona, a flat overlooking the alley with a balcony.  Feeling the atmosphere and energy.  The owners are a wonderful young couple who are working very hard to start a business with no time to themselves it seems.  Their shop right underneath their flat, Rustica, has the best coffee and pastries.  The flat is perfectly located for all the top sites to see in Barcelona.  Easy access to mass transportation.  Great eating within a stones throw if too tired to go hunting further.  The only downside is the noise you get in the alley with the bars and restaurants open late.  Bring ear plugs.  Loved their dog Luna who is very well behaved.  She had happy hour with us on the balcony both nights and loved the attention.  We would definitely stay here again.  It was the perfect place just to lay a head down because we were rarely there as we were seeing the city.  Elodie always was eager to help us with directions and always a smile.

Al reservar tenía una valoración de 4,5 lo cual no coincide para nada con la realidad. No se le puede dar ni un 3 y me da mucha pena porque me caían bien como personas. Pero no puedo escribir una valoración buena, si fue todo lo contrario. Esto lo digo como ex-superhost con valoración 5 y más de 60 valoraciones en 6 años.

We wen’t able to get any rest due to all the street noise. \\n\\nSecondly the apartment has about 5 bedrooms and all were being used as Airbnb’s. The main issue I had was that the 1 bathroom - and all say it again the 1 bathroom was being used by 10 people at once. It’s was horrible, I had to wait 1 hour everyday in the morning just to use the toilet or shower. They had no hand soap and we would run out of toilet paper often. I tried contacting the host a few times regarding this issue, the response was fast but the results were horrible. The host promised hand soap a few times and it never came, also she said the toilet paper would be provided on a as needed bases.  I ended up buying my own toilet paper it was just a big inconvenience. And the bathroom was never cleaned the entire stay, it would have been great if they cleaned it more often considering all the guest that used it. \\n   \\nEveryday I saw a girl come to the apartment to change the bedsheets of guest checking out so I assumed she was the housekeeper. I asked her for hand soap and toilet paper and she seemed so bothered that I even asked for anything. She was just rude, anyway I realized later after looking at the Airbnb picture she was the host.

I was met off the airport shuttle in control Barcelona, was handed the key and a (Hidden by Airbnb) map of where to find the apartment etc.  Highly recommended and if/when I visit Barcelona again I'd definitely stay here.  Free Wifi was a huge bonus too.\",\n",

The apartments are as described and everything about our stay was as seamless as possible. Akira is a friendly, accommodating and considerate host who really seems to care about his tenants and making sure their stay is as easy as possible. He is incredibly approachable and easy to work with. I highly recommend staying at any of his properties, and would stay again in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Barcelona!\",\n",

Having somewhere central with high speed internet access was a real bonus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flat is very well equipped, very clean when we arrived and the people who met us were very efficient and informative. As I work in Barcelona 2-3 times per year I will definitely be coming back. I will also be recommending this flat to colleagues and associates.',\n",
       "       \"This is a smart flat in a great location. I stayed here during the MWC and it's easy enough to get to and from the exhibition centre. The neighbourhood has everything you need in terms of shops, bars and restaurants and the city centre is an easy walk away. The sunny balcony in the afternoons is a big plus and the flat is very well equipped for all your techie requirements.\",\n",

FIrst of all the location is great and thus it is in the center it is still a very calm place. She has a nice balcony outside which is quite rare in these kind of houses as she told us. Everything was clean and organised and there is anything you need for a business trip or vacation. I also found Mires to be a great host and will hopefully be able to return there one day. ',\n",

I would recommend staying here and plan on doing so myself next year for MWC.\",\n",

You cannot find a better place to stay if you are a budget traveller.  Highly recommended',\n",

Really close to transport links, Carrer de Blai is just around the corner and it's not too far to the old parts of the city. Montserrat is very nice and easy to contact. Welcome gift was a lovely touch. All in all - recommended! \",\n",

We booked it for a week and didn't get any special pricing. The water boiler was always malfunctioning so you had to turn it on and off and wait a bit before having hot water which was inconvenient given the premium price being paid for a business-service. Communication and check-in was seamless.\",\n",

Since MWC is at Fira Europa, my commute was an 5-minute walk to Placa Espanya, and then the train 3 stops to MWC. All together about 15-20 minutes door-to-door, or take a taxi which is about the same amount of time in high traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a very clean, high quality apartment, in an excellent location with proximity to the Poble Sec Metro stop (which gets you to all the best places within a few minutes). \\r\\n\\r\\nAgus provided great communication, and met us at the flat. He provided a \"starter kit\" of coffee, milk, bread, and fruit for the breakfast the next day. Also, he answered questions about the neighborhood including restaurants, market, etc. They have a board with cards from nearby restaurants recommended by them and their guests, which was great.\\r\\n\\r\\nPROS: Great Location with excellent metro access, Fun Building, Clean and modern apartment, good beds, great shower and hot water pressure, amenities such as hair dryer and iron/ironing board included, resonable quality wi-fi, good heating, nice modern kitchen with coffee maker, toaster, microwave.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONS: Street noise (for those who are sensitive) - it\\'s right outside Av. de Parallel, which is a \"main drag\" and the motor scooter traffic can be problematic (Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper).

After my arrival in the evening, the next morning i needed to iron a shirt early in the morning for my first meeting at the MWC2019. Unfortunately I search for 30 minutes the whole appartment and i could not find the iron. There was the iron board but not the iron. I managed to reach the host after several attempts (not easy to reach her) and told her about the problem. She said there is iron in the room. i said no there isn\\'t. She then promised to send one. She said the cleannig lady comes at 9am so she will bring it. I waited 45 minutes until 9:15 and nobody came. I called her and asked her where the iron is. At this point, I was getting extremely nervous as it was getting very tight to reach my first meeting at 10am (terrible traffic towards MWC, especially on the first day of the event). She said \"Oh sorry, I sent it to the wrong apartment, to somebody else\". Now i started getting very worried and upset. I started calling her a few more times to check whats going. She said somebody will deliver it soon, very soon. It took another 45 minutes until somebody brought a new iron around 10am. Of course I missed my first meeting which as you can imagine is an UNACCEPTABLE situation. I am a Director at Samsung Electronics and I had very high level executive meetings planned for the whole day. Missing my first big meeting is a TERRIBLE situation for my career. It disappointed heavily our leadership team. I complained to AirBNB and requested a financial compensation to this huge invonvenience. AirBNB support said they will contact the host and request this. I did not get any reimbursement or any phone call or an apology email. I find this extremely rude, unprofessional and unacceptable. I do not recommend using this place for business.\\n\\n€350 per night is a ridiculous price, especially for this apartment. The couch is extremely dirty. I did not want to and could not sit there. The bed was very uncomfortable. The bathroom is extremely small. The shower doesnt work well. Also before my arrival i asked if there is a Nespresso machine. The host said yes, so i brought nespresso capsules. It turned out a totally different coffee machine, so i could not drink coffee in the mornings and also carried nespresso capsules unnecessarily. Also the TV is terrible. there are no proper TV channels, not even at least CNN or BBC. Plus there is an alarm system which you have to arm and disarm all the time which is a big hassle. Also there are 2 big cameras in the apartment which made me very uncomfortable. The location of the apartment is good but there are many hundreds of other apartments that all have very good locations, even better than this one. So overall, i am extremely disappointed with my experience.',\n",

You do get some road and people noise.  Also, being in a block you do get noise from above and from the central stairwell.  Most of this noise quietens down by 12pm midnight though.

I actually asked to be partially refunded because it wasn't confortable all week long and because I paid a lot (152$/night) for the value I received.. Yes prices are very high during MWC and that's normal, but it was the same price in the days following the event...

While all the other rooms were extremely overpriced, Elvira offered me the room for only 20 euros a night. So my expectations of the room were not very high. But I was extremely positively surprised!\\n\\nMassive front door with security lock. Inviting house entrance. Modern elevator. The apartment itself was not very modern, but that was not to be expected for this cheap price. There was everything I needed: the room and bathroom were very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the mattress perfect for a good night\\'s sleep, the closet was big enough for all my dress and suitcase. For charging cell phones, tablets, etc. is electricity in the room available, I even got a multiple socket.\\n\\nMetro stations for all major lines (L1, L2) are within a few minutes walk. Only 50 meters away is the cafe \"365\", where you get one of the best coffees in the city (large cup only 2.50 euros) and a large selection of freshly baked baguettes, cakes and particles for about 2-3 euros. There are several 24h-supermarkets only a few meters away.\\n\\nElvira or Nestor ALWAYS reply in a few minutes and give useful hints for the stay. Both are extremely nice and considerate.\\n\\nNext time in Barcelona I will definitely book again this room and I highly recommend this place!!!',\n",

Going to MWC, for instance, or airport, is really easy. All commodities around : nice local supermarket (with bio products, and good wines) next door, nice and affordable restaurants around.
